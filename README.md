# RedesignRoverP6Parts
This was a group coursework in the course F27WD;
The objective was to pick a questionable real world website and to redesign it while using better fit principles of design.

The website that our group had chosen was http://www.roverp6parts.com/ 

This repository contains the files for the redesign.

The redesign can at 25/09/2022 be viewed live at https://johanjohnthomas.github.io/RedesignRoverP6Parts/
